BOOKSTORE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - MID SUBMISSION

PROJECT: Multi-Index Database for Bookstore Management


WHAT I HAVE COMPLETED SO FAR:

Data Structures (3 implemented):
- Hash Table for fast ISBN lookup
- B-Tree for organizing books by category
- AVL Tree for filtering books by price range

Main Features Working:
- Adding new books to the system
- Searching books by ISBN number
- Viewing all books sorted by category
- Filtering books within a price range
- Data saves automatically to bookstore_data.txt file
- System loads previous data when restarted

Backend System:
- Built a C++ HTTP server that handles requests
- Created DatabaseManager that controls all three data structures
- Four API endpoints working:
  * Add new book
  * Search by ISBN
  * Filter by price
  * Get full inventory
- File operations for saving and loading data

Frontend Interface:
- Web page with forms to add books
- Search box for finding books by ISBN
- Price filter with min/max inputs
- Table showing all books in inventory
- Everything connects to backend through HTTP requests

Testing Done:
- Tested each data structure separately
- Tested all features working together
- Verified frontend talks to backend correctly
- Confirmed data saves and loads properly


WHAT REMAINS TO BE DONE:

Additional Features Needed:
- Add update function to change book details
- Add delete function to remove books
- Implement one or two more data structures
- Better error handling and input validation



HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:

Compile Backend:
g++ Backend/main.cpp DataStructures/DatabaseManager.cpp DataStructures/HashTable.cpp DataStructures/BTree.cpp DataStructures/AVLTree.cpp -o server -IDataStructures -IBackend -lws2_32

Run Server:
./server.exe

Access Frontend:
Open Frontend/index.html in any web browser

Note: Backend runs on http://localhost:9000


CURRENT STATUS:

Overall Progress: About 50% complete
- Core functionality is fully working
- All three main data structures implemented
- Backend and frontend successfully connected
- Basic features operational

Next Steps:
- Add update and delete operations
- Consider adding more data structures
- Improve documentation
- Enhance error handling


IMPORTANT NOTES:

The system is working well with the three data structures integrated properly. 
Data persists between sessions. Frontend and backend communicate without issues.
Ready to demonstrate current features.

The project handles the basic bookstore operations efficiently and is stable 
for the features implemented so far.

Final deployment on AWS is planned once all core functionality is complete.
